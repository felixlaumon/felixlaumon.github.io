<p><em>All trypophobia-triggering images are blocked in this Google Image search</em></p>

<h3 id="what-is-trypophobia">What is Trypophobia?</h3>

<p>Trypophobia is a specific phobia of a cluster of small holes. The most
well-known trigger is lotus seedheads. In a relatively small study done in 2013,
16% of the 286 participants experience discomfort when shown
trypophobia-triggering photos.</p>

<p>Trypohobia is not a well-studied phenomenon so there is very little
understanding of the cause and treatment. To make things worse, people on the
Internet sometimes intentionally photoshop lotus seedhead or other
trypophobia-triggering patterns to normal images. If you have trypophobia, it
might be a nightmare to just browse the net because you never know when the
dreaded lotus seedhead is going to show up. This chrome extension prevent users
with trypophobia from exposing to these trypophobia-triggering images.</p>

<p>Rest assured that I am <em>not</em> going to show any trpophobia-triggering images in this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-trypophobia-blocker-do">What does Trypophobia Blocker do?</h3>

<p>Trypophobia Blocker contains a convolutional neural network that can classify
whether an image is trypophobia-triggering or not. This neural network is run
against all images displayed on a page and blurs out any images that are
trypophobia triggering. No data is sent to me as all computation occurs locally.</p>

<p>Users have the option to provide feedback for the network — you can unblur and
image if you think it is a regular image, or you can blur out the image manually
if it is triggering trypophobia. The image URL is sent to a server to improve
the dataset and the model further. Users’ IPs or browsing history is not
recorded.</p>

<p>The network is validated against a hold-out test set and has a precision of
97.12% and a recall of 85.63%. More on this test set in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-project">Why this Project?</h3>

<p>This idea comes from my girlfriend who suffers from a pretty severe case of
trypophobia. When she browse Instagram or Facebook, she always find unexpected
images on triggering her trypophobia. I thought this is a perfect use case how
deep learning can be used to improve someone’s quality of life.</p>

<h3 id="show-me-the-dataset">Show Me the Dataset</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/trypophobia-blocker/k8s-cron-job.png" alt="" />
<em>Cron jobs are scheduled on a kubernetes cluster to download the latest images
from various subreddits.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps surprising to the general public about AI, the most important component
of this project is actually the dataset, especially for a well-established
problem like this — image classification. A good amount of effort is spent on
scraping the Internet for trypophobia-triggering images.</p>

<p>The base of this dataset comes from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cytadela8/trypophobia">Artur Puzio’s dataset on
Kaggle</a> This contains 6k
trypophobia-triggering images by scraping Google Image and the r/trypophobia
subreddit, and 10.5k normal images.</p>

<p>I further expanded this dataset by scraping
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/trypophobia/">r/trypophobia</a> subreddit every 6 hours
and gather normal images by scraping images from 15 other subreddits (e.g.
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/pics">r/pics</a>,
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/">r/OldSchoolCool</a>,
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/memes">r/memes</a>,
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/aww/">r/aww</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>One challenge of gathering this dataset is that the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/dev/api/">Reddit
API</a> does not return all posts, but only the
top or most recent 1000 posts. So to capture all images submitted to the
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/trypophobia/">r/trypophobia</a> subreddit, the crawler is
schdeuled to run every 6 hours.</p>

<p>To better measure real-world performance, special care is taken to curate the
test dataset. Below shows the construction of the test set.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Normal”
    <ul>
      <li>Top-100 most upvoted images all-time</li>
      <li>Top-50 most upvoted images today</li>
      <li>Top-50 most upvoted image this week</li>
      <li>Top-50 most upvoted images this month</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Trypophobia-triggering”
    <ul>
      <li>Top-25 most upvoted images in r/trypophobia all-time</li>
      <li>Top-25 most upvoted images in r/trypophobia this week</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The test set is constructed in the way that it emphasizes popular images because
they are the images that the user might stumble into after all.</p>

<p>As of February 2021, this dataset now has almost 300k images with 14k being
trypophobia-triggering.</p>

<h3 id="model-training">Model Training</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/trypophobia-blocker/model-wandb.png" alt="" />
<em>Model training metrics on <a href="https://wandb.ai/home">Weights and Biases</a></em></p>

<p>The underlying model is a fine-tuned <a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/">MobileNet
v1</a> with 2.23M parameters. I tried
to use a more modern network like
<a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/efficientnet/">EfficientNet-b0</a> but
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs">Tensorflow.js</a> does not seem to be able to
convert the weights and the graph correctly.</p>

<p>Another unexplored alternative is to use a shallower network. A shallower
network (fewer layers and FLOPs) makes sense in this use-case because the
trypophobia-triggering pattern is local and context is usually not necessary to
classify whether the image is trypophobia-triggering.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-the-labels">Fixing the Labels</h3>

<p>A sharp reader must have noticed that we are treating images outside the
r/trypophobia as normal. But this is untrue — a top-voted image can be
trypophobia-triggering.</p>

<p>So every time a model is trained, labeling jobs are created to correct the image
with suspicious labels. Specifically, we select <strong>ambiguous</strong> images (with
predicted probability close to 0.5), <strong>strong false positive</strong> (i.e. images with
the normal label but predicted to be trypophobia-triggering with high
confidence) and <strong>strong false negative</strong> (i.e. images labeled as
trypophobia-triggering but predicted to be normal with high confidence.)</p>

<p>Roughly 500 images will be relabeled each round and about 40% of the labels will
be corrected by human moderators.</p>

<h3 id="deploying-as-chrome-extension">Deploying as Chrome Extension</h3>

<p>Now that we have a trained model, we would like to run our trained model on
every image that the browser is showing the user. However, this is easier than
done.</p>

<p>The Chrome extension has two components: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content.js</code> that get injected into the
webpage and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background.js</code> that runs in the background.</p>

<p>I set up 2 types of event listeners on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content.js</code> — <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOMContentLoaded</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MutationObserver</code>. When an image gets added to the DOM, it will be blurred out
since we don’t know whether it’s trypophobia triggering or not. Then a “message”
containing the image URL will be sent to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background.js</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background.js</code>
contains the network and listen to all the messages from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content.js</code>.</p>

<p>Once <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content.js</code> hears back from model inference results from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background.js</code>,
it will either apply a stronger blur if the image is trypophobia triggering or
remove the blur entirely for normal images.</p>

<h3 id="user-feedback">User Feedback</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/trypophobia-blocker/right-click-menu.png" alt="Right click menu" /></p>

<p>If the model makes a mistake in the wild, there is a mechanism to allow the user
to provide feedback to the model. The user can either report an image as
trypophobia-triggering and blurs out the image, or reveal a blurred image and
report the image as normal. This feedback is logged in a simple flask app hosted
on Heroku.</p>

<p>This Heroku app uses a Postgres database to store the user feedback. Only the
image URL and time of submission are collected and browsing history is not
recorded in any way.</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>Shipping a production machine learning model end-to-end is rarely talked about.
Most focus on the glory parts of machine learning, such as new fancy
architecture, an outrageous amount of parameters, or the global-warming-inducing
amount of GPUs required to train the model.</p>

<p>This project shows you that data collection, user-feedback for continuous
improvement are just as important as the model itself. We are in an era where
every software engineer can easily develop a machine learning model. Machine
learning practitioners should put more focus on what happens before model
training and after model training.</p>
