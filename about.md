Hi there! I am Felix Lau. I am a Hong Kong-born software engineer turned data scientist. I am interested in data visualization, machine learning and user interface design.

I am working at [Arterys](https://arterys.com/) as machine learning scientist.

Previously, I worked at [Alvanon](http://alvanon.com/) and I built computer vision and analytics system for the fashion and retailing industry.

Before that, I worked as a software engineer at [Onswipe](https://angel.co/onswipe) where I developed its core publishing platform and [touch-optimized user interface engine](https://vimeo.com/44825526). I also optimized its [advertising platform](https://vimeo.com/41152592) which has served over 120 million unique users and was used by top-tier online publications.
