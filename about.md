Hi there! I am Felix Lau. I am a Hong Kong-born software engineer turned data
scientist. I am interested in data visualization, machine learning and user
interface design.

I am currently working at [Scale AI](https://scale.com/) as a research engineer
to speed up and improve the quality of data annotations.

Previously, I worked at [Arterys](https://arterys.com/) as a machine learning
scientist, developing numerous FDA-cleared deep learning models that speed up
the workflow of radiologists. I published
[ScarGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04500) which can simulate rare diseases on
MRI scans for data augmentation.

Prior to that, I worked at [Alvanon](http://alvanon.com/) and built computer
vision and analytics system for the fashion and retailing industry.

My first job was at [Onswipe](https://angel.co/onswipe) as a software engineer
where I developed its core publishing platform and [touch-optimized user
interface engine](https://vimeo.com/44825526). I also optimized its [advertising
platform](https://vimeo.com/41152592) which has served over 120 million unique
users and was used by top-tier online publications.
